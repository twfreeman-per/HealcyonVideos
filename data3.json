As with the other Branches of TCM, healing occurs through balancing qi or electromagnetic energy which surrounds and pervades all living creatures.</p></span></li></ol></div></div></div><p>Disruptions in the electromagnetic energy of the body occur throughout our lifetime as a result of poor diet, sedentary lifestyle, injuries, surgery, suppression of emotions, and aging. The goal of qigong is to correct these bio-energetic imbalances and blockages. This enables the body to strengthen and regulate the internal organs, the nervous system and the immune system, relieve pain, regulate hormones, and strengthen and release deep-seated emotions and stress.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><p>Medical qigong therapy consists of treatment by a practitioner to regulate the client's qi. After the treatment the client will be given qigong prescriptions to assist in their ongoing healing. Tailored specifically to the clientmedical qigong exercises use physical movement, breathing methods and mental intention to correct and restore the function in the body.</p></span></li></ol></div></div></div><p>Medical qigong is a complete system of health care that recognizes the root causes of symptoms or disease, and treats the client as a whole. Practiced as an excellent adjunct to Western medicine, Chinese medicine may successfully treat people with conditions which Western medicine finds resistant or ambiguous.</p></span></li></ol></div></div></div><p>In China and more recently in the United States, doctors have applied qigong in hospitals and clinics to treat individuals suffering from a variety of ailments. Medical qigong therapy and prescriptions can be used to treat people with cancer and help reduce or eliminate side effects from radiation and chemotherapy. It will help in treating cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease and post-stroke syndrome. It is especially useful in treating any kind of chronic pain, and chronic disorders of the digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular and nervous systems.</p></span></li></ol></div></div></div><p>Like any other system of health care, qigong is not a panacea but a highly effective health care practice. Many health care professionals recommend qigong as an important form of complementary and alternative medicine.</p>"

Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero). Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type UInt8, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type Int32. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names. In most cases, you don't need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code. Swift provides an additional integer type, Int, which has the same size as the current platform's native word size:</p><ul class=\"simple\"><li>On a 32-bit platform, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int</span></code> is the same size as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int32</span></code>.</li><li>On a 64-bit platform, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int</span></code> is the same size as <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Int64</span></code>.</li></ul><p>Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer, always use Int for integer values in your code. This aids code consistency and interoperability. Even on 32-bit platforms, Int can store any value between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, and is large enough for many integer ranges.</p><p>Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.14159, 0.1, and -273.15. Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an Int. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:</p><ul class=\"simple\"><li><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Double</span></code> represents a 64-bit floating-point number.</li><li><code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">Float</span></code> represents a 32-bit floating-point number.</li></ul>"

An optional represents two possibilities: Either there is a value, and you can unwrap the optional to access that value, or there isn't a value at all.</p><p>Here's an example of how optionals can be used to cope with the absence of a value. Swift's Int type has an initializer which tries to convert a String value into an Int value. However, not every string can be converted into an integer. The string \"123\" can be converted into the numeric value 123, but the string 'hello, world' doesn't have an obvious numeric value to convert to.</p><p>The example below uses the initializer to try to convert a String into an Int:</p><div class='highlight-swift notranslate'><div class='code-sample'><div class='Swift highlight'><ol class='code-lines'><li><span class='k'>let</span> <span class='nv'>possibleNumber</span> = <span class='s'>\"123\"</span></li><li><span class='k'>let</span> <span class='nv'>convertedNumber</span> = <span class='nv'>Int</span>(<span class='nv'>possibleNumber</span>) </li><li><span class='c'>// convertedNumber is inferred to be of type 'Int?', or 'optional Int'</span> </li></ol></div></div></div><p>Because the initializer might fail, it returns an optional Int, rather than an Int. An optional Int is written as Int?, not Int. The question mark indicates that the value it contains is optional, meaning that it might contain some Int value, or it might contain no value at all. (It can't contain anything else, such as a Bool value or a String value. It's either an Int, or it's nothing at all.)</p><p>You can use an if statement to find out whether an optional contains a value by comparing the optional against nil. You perform this comparison with the \"equal to\" operator (==) or the \"not equal to\" operator (!=).</p><div class=\"highlight-swift notranslate\"><div class=\"code-sample\"><div class=\"Swift highlight\"><ol class=\"code-lines\"><li><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"nv\">convertedNumber</span> != <span class=\"k\">nil</span> {</li><li>    <span class=\"nv\">print</span>(<span class=\"s\">\"convertedNumber contains some integer value.\"</span>)</li><li>}</li><li><span class=\"c\">// Prints \"convertedNumber contains some integer value.\"</span></li></ol></div></div></div>"
